            <p style= text-indent:50px;>Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company founded by Pankaj Chaddah and Deepinder Goyal in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. As of 2019, the service is available in 24 countries and in more than 10,000 cities.<br>
                In February 2017, Zomato announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure services, a service to help restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[27][28] In September 2017, Zomato claimed the company had "turned profitable" in all 24 countries where it operated and introduced a "zero-commission model" for partner restaurants.[29] Towards the end of 2017, Zomato stopped accepting updates from its active users by not utilizing moderators to verify and make updates. Users of the app reported issues with new features to pay for orders</p>
